    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Our Story</h1>
    <p class="mb-6">InMatch didn’t just start as a platform — it started as a personal struggle.

I’ve always been a football lover. But over time, I realized life doesn’t always give you the space to sit and watch 90 minutes of live action. Between school, work, and daily hustle, I kept missing matches that mattered most to me. I’d catch score updates, maybe read headlines — but the passion, the thrill, the moments that define football? They were gone before I even knew it.

That’s when the idea hit me: What if there was a way to experience football highlights in real time, as if you were watching live?

That’s how InMatch was born.

We built this platform for people just like me — people who love football but don’t always have the time to sit through live games. On InMatch, you get instant highlights, live updates, scores, and even video rants where fans share raw reactions — so it feels like you never missed the match at all.

At InMatch, we’re not just giving you results; we’re giving you the feeling of the game. Whether you’re on the move, at work, or just busy with life, InMatch brings the match to you — fast, engaging, and unfiltered.

Football is passion, and passion deserves to be felt in the moment. That’s the story of InMatch — my story, and now yours.</p>
